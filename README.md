# TimeScaleNet API & App 

**Empowering Environmental Sound Recognition for Hearing Accessibility**

## Abstract  
TimeScaleNet leverages **Deep Learning** techniques to process raw audio waveforms with multi-resolution analysis. Initially introduced by researchers at the **CNAM**, it features **BiquadNet** (a learnable passband IIR filter layer) and **FrameNet** (a residual network with depthwise separable convolutions) to analyze sounds at sample and frame scales. Our project optimizes TimeScaleNet for real-world deployment on portable devices, achieving significant accuracy improvements.
